Once upon a time, there was a sad boy living in a village. He had no friends and was excluded in everything. He lost his parents to a terrible plague before he was born.

Then one day the sad boy fell down and hurt his knee.  This made him even
sadder, because hurt knees are some of the saddest things in the world.  They're
potentially the saddest, but additional research is needed to confirm this.

And another year, the sad boy was adopted by a crazy couple in his town. He was figuring ways to get away from them. 

So he ran away until the boy arrived at another town hours away from home. The boy was lost but atleast he had a chance to start over. He looked for a job the next day but unfortunately broke his arm.
